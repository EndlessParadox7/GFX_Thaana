## Important!!
 - KNOWN ISSUE: Text wrapping is enabled, when disabled. Enabling it may cause the library to behave unexpectedly.
 - Requires Adafruit GFX library.
 - Requires a compatible Adafruit driver for your display.
 - The library was tested with Arduino IDE 1.8.16 running on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS. Other combinations of software/OS might not work.
 - Fonts are stored in your MCUs programme memory. Make sure your chosen MCU has enough memory to hold the font file and the programme you are writing.

## What is GFX_Thaana?
 - An Arduino Library.
 - Adds a Thaana character formatter/decoder to all Adafruit GFX based Arduino libraries.
 - Bundles mainstream Thaana 8-Bit GFXfonts compatible with Afadruit GFX library.


## Compatibility

All libraries based on the Adafruit GFX engine are supported. This is an incomplete
list of such libraries. Probably many more are supported:
